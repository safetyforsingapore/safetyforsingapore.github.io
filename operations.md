# Hydra-22 suppression operations
Since April 2023, the victims have been subject to a continuous slew of operations by the Christian far-right to detain, discredit, and otherwise make them unable to testify against Mercury and the Christian far-right. The following illustrative diagram is taken from Carissa's [100 page letter to the President of Singapore and the Attorney-General's Chambers](https://victimsofmalice.com/3rd-letter-3-bundles-release/).

### Operation Mandrake
* J-min's maternal grandfather had been warded at Sengkang General Hospital and was discharged on 8 April 2023.
* He passed away at their family home on 10 April 2023.
* Mercury claimed his death as a murder, carried out by her girlfriend Heather by poisoning.
* [According to Mercury](https://victimsofmalice.com/mercury-claims-9th-murder-jia-mins-grandfather/), Heather learned about J-min's grandfather's whereabouts from people at Church Of Our Savior, who had connections to staff at Sengkang General Hospital.
* The murder turned out to be part of [Operation Mandrake](https://victimsofmalice.com/mandrake-werewolf-poison-ivy/), to frame J-min for the murder:
> "Operation Mandrake for J-min to either rot in prison for twenty years or hang for murder [...] Operation Mandrake is supposed to get J-min pinned for her grandfather's murder. It actually started off as a possibility after she'd [jokingly] told some folks multiple times that she hopes her grandfather would stop being so stubborn and just die, so she can take over his room and not have to share a room with [J-min's sister]. Ms Carol Loi correctly predicted what would be J-min's reaction after her grandfather's sudden death and learning [from Mercury] that it was not so natural, so J-min opposed any autopsy until J-min herself becomes the top suspect. The autopsy itself was blocked through indirect arrangements made by the Attorney-General, like ensuring the death case IO was away on field duty and could not be reached by [Carissa]."
* The intention was to arrest and arraign J-min on the morning of Pink Dot 2023, Singapore's annual LGBTQ+ rally, and portray her as a "mentally unstable lesbian" in the resulting media coverage.

### Operation Poison Ivy
* Death row inmate Tangaraju s/o Suppiah was executed in Singapore on 26 April 2023 for drug offences.
* Harvey attended Tangaraju's funeral on 28 April 2023, where [Heather spiked her beverage with Phencyclidine (PCP) at about 7.20pm](https://twitter.com/quantumcatgirl/status/1668591095104798720/photo/2).
* On 29th and 30th April 2023, enraged at the injustice of Tangaraju's execution and under the influence of PCP, Harvey posted [two Instagram Stories](https://victimsofmalice.com/execution-tangaraju-suppiah/) describing violent acts towards the President of Singapore.
* On the evening of 30th April 2023, a disproportionate police presence descended upon Harvey's residence, including [at least 15 officers, a Special Operations Command vehicle, and a sniper](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIK2x7rF1L/?img_index=7), in order to bring her in for questioning. [The police expressed](https://victimsofmalice.com/execution-tangaraju-suppiah/) that Harvey's Stories constituted a national security threat and wanted to charge her for Offences against the President's person, or Criminal Intimidation.
* The police eventually settled on an arrangement to interrogate Harvey on 3 May 2023, where she was eventually charged with a more minor charge of [PoHA ยง5(2) "Fear, provocation or facilitation of violence"](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIK2x7rF1L/?img_index=9).
* On Harvey's court date for the above charge on May 5, Harvey was [remanded to the Institute of Mental Health](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr2ixKwpxUU/). She was released from IMH on [May 12](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsYIx0epGxE/).
* This was all part of [Operation Poison Ivy](https://victimsofmalice.com/mandrake-werewolf-poison-ivy/):
> Operation Poison Ivy intends to coercively extract a false testimony out of Harvey to help frame Jia Min for the murder of Jia Min's own grandfather. The bonus of sending Harvey to remand is also to traumatize and psychologically break Harvey so that Harvey will not be a credible victim or witness in the case against Mercury. Through Operation Poison Ivy, Operation Mandrake succeeds.
* As a result, J-min went to the U.K. to seek asylum and is still there at the time of writing.

### Operation Werewolf
* **Lune Loh** had participated in the [#FixSchoolsNotStudents protest](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/three-people-arrested-for-protesting-outside-ministry-of-education) outside the Ministry of Education headquarters in Singapore on 26 January 2021, and is otherwise a visible trans activist. [Operation Werewolf](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-louve-garoul/) aimed to punish her for her activism.
* An accuser (whom Lune has never met) filed a rape report against Lune, with the rape alleged to have occurred in September 2022.
* The rape report was escalated to the Serious Sexual Crime Branch (SSCB), who were not privy to Operation Werewolf.
* On the instruction of contacts from Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC), the accuser went to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychiatrist participating in Operation Werewolf to bolster the credibility of the rape accusation.
* The accuser was also trained to provide convincing video testimony against Lune to get her extradited from the UK.
* However, the accuser has since been apprehended for multiple drug offences, bringing the credibility of their testimony against Lune into question.
* Operation Werewolf has thus **failed**.

### Operation Pillory
Operation Pillory is an operation spearheaded by [Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC)](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/thousands-wear-white-church-service-defend-family-values), especially through [Nina Khong](https://mothership.sg/2015/06/pastor-lawrence-khong-we-will-wear-white-until-the-pink-is-gone/) (wife of [Lawrence Khong](https://www.facebook.com/lawrence.khong.fcbc/posts/the-greatest-fallacy-of-the-lgbt-argument-is-i-have-no-choice-i-am-born-this-way/706846362692814/)), to frame Harvey for sexual crimes.

There have been [four iterations](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-pillory-versions-2-3-4/) of this operation:
1. A plan to get 10 to 15 women, recruited from short-term visitors, to accuse Harvey of molesting them, with the idea that even though all cases would result in "No Further Action", there'd be enough public disrepute. Recruitment of accusers was unsuccessful, hence this version was scrapped.
2. A plan to get Harvey charged for rape, but because Attorney General [Lucien Wong](#lucien-wong) wanted to be extra sure that Harvey wouldn't successfully wiggle out by citing HRT, he checked her medical file, and found that she likely can't hold an erection either way because she has artificial phimosis from genital injuries gotten in 2013 somehow. Rape claims would not really be credible, hence scrapped.
3. To accuse Harvey of having committed rape "using her medical-grade dildo, since she has admitted on police records to using such dildos in the past to pee in public." However, Attorney General [Lucien Wong](#lucien-wong) "didn't think the story would hold up in Court from a psychological perspective, and even the Serious Sexual Crime Branch (SSCB) might be rather suspicious." Scrapped.
4. "To use NEETs [Not in Education, Employment, or Training] indirectly recruited through the Faith Community Baptist Church's (FCBC) Digital Wellness programme to create accounts and profiles under Harvey's name and pester girls to have sex till they get fed up and file police reports against Harvey for harassment". Began on 5 June 2023, and one police report was lodged within a week.

### Operation Louve-Garoul
* The Witherspoon Institute learned from the failure of Operation Werewolf in Singapore, and have determined that if they try something against Lune in Singapore, there is an at least 50% chance it will fail. Therefore, they will carry out this operation in the U.K., where Lune is currently studying for her Master's.
* [Operation Louve-Garoul](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-louve-garoul/) is the U.K. version of Operation Werewolf, spearheaded by a minor political party in the U.K., Plaid Gristnogol Cymru (a.k.a. the Welsh Christian Party), whose leaders are in contact with two people in CanaVox's reading group in Brighton.
* Two child false victims in Surrey have been found, to claim that they were groomed by Lune to sexually penetrate her.
  * The two children are known to have had prior carnal connection with adults (suspected to be clergy), but the parents intend to claim Lune as the perpetrator.
* The parents of one of the false victims made a police report against Lune on 15 June 2023.
* The goal is to get Lune charged with child sexual abuse, which is a serious enough to force her to live in Approved Premises (AP) while awaiting trial.
* APs are sex-segregated, and as Lune is legally male, she would most likely be placed in the male section. This would likely cause her emotional distress.
* Witherspoon/CanaVox/Plaid Gristnogol Cymru further intend to pay one or more residents of the AP where Lune would reside to attack her andd ensure her mental breakage.
* Psychological effects against Lune aside, if Lune is successfully charged and discredited, her own asylum claim that she was considering due to Operation Werewolf, as well as J-min's in-progress asylum claim, would be affected. J-min might end up unsuccessful in claiming asylum and be forced to return to Singapore.

### Operation Ink Tiger
* This section is summarized from a report submitted to Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) on [20 July 2023](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvdQbc_rkbr/), then released to various media outlets on [2 August 2023](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvdQXOsL0gc).
* [Operation Ink Tiger](https://textdoc.co/FGh6VD3R4ZkBrOXQ) is an operation to destroy evidence held by law enforcement that could implicate Mercury.
* Some in the ruling People's Action Party are worried that if Mercury and Harvey's cases are more widely known, they will be at far greater risk of losing the next General Election.
* Operation Ink Tiger was led by then-Speaker of Parliament **Tan Chuan-Jin**. Prime Minister **Lee Hsien Loong** delegated his powers over the Internal Security Department to Tan to carry it out, while insisting that he does not want to know the details of the operation.
  * Shortly after this, Tan resigned from Parliament โ "at least in some part related to "Operation Ink Tiger" in addition to his extramarital affair".
  * As political commentary, taking note of the [timing/timeline of events](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lee-hsien-loong-ministerial-statement-tan-chuan-jin-cheng-li-hui-affair-3671496), it appears that the scandal of Tan's extramarital affair is merely a distraction and excuse to justify his exit from Parliament. It is likely that the high-risk decisions he made for Operation Ink Tiger were met with substantial disagreement internally (i.e. pushback and divide within the state itself, which is never a monolith), resulting in the need to discard him in case he becomes a liability to the party image.
* Following Tan's resignation from Parliament, Operation Ink Tiger was handed to Leader of the House **Indranee Rajah**, with Minister for Trade and Industry **Gan Kim Yong** and new Speaker of Parliament **Seah Kian Peng** as the number 2 and number 3 respectively.
* The Thio family and one Senior Counsel Kuah Boon Theng are also aware of Operation Ink Tiger, and have differing levels of involvement respectively.
* Regarding the [death of Harvey's grandmother](#mercurys-harassment-of-victims-drawn-from-brown-dot) on 8 September 2022, an autopsy did find a substance in her body, but this was covered up with a new report stating the cause of death as natural. The assistant medical examiner involved in the autopsy threatened to file a corruption complaint regarding this and has since been detained under the Internal Security Act.
* The Internal Security Department has taken evidence from at least three police land divisions to be brought to Senoko Incineration Plant for incineration.
* **J-min** and **Beatrice** ([Mercury's stepsister](#mercury)) are being monitored as people who can testify against Mercury. Beatrice is a minor, so the Internal Security Department is seeing if they can detain her whole family instead.
* Tan Chuan-Jin had given instructions for Mercury's existing criminal cases to be brought forward. Mercury is expected to accuse Harvey as the mastermind of the anthrax hoax to shift the case to Harvey, following which Mercury will be assisted in moving to Texas and evade cross-examination. Anyone who testifies against Mercury will then be charged with lying under oath.
* According to the whistleblower's document, Operation Ink Tiger is said to have been completed on or around 24 or 25 July 2023.
  * Mercury had a [court date as late as 10 Aug 2023](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/hearing-list/hearing-list-details/ds-4-100001400023). One might infer that the "completion" of Operation Ink Tiger refers only to completion of the evidence suppression portions of the operation, and not the part about moving Mercury to Texas.

### Cost orders for Harvey's lawyer
* Several prosecutors in the Attorney-General's Chambers have been tasked to [informally spread word](https://victimsofmalice.com/agc-informally-deters-lawyer-representing-harvey-trial/) through the Law Society that any lawyer who represents Harvey will get cost orders imposed on them if they lose, for ostensibly conducting an unmeritorious defense.
  * This is an intimidation tactic to prevent Harvey from being represented.

### Operation UltraViolet
[Operations UltraViolet I-III](https://twitter.com/safety4harveyUS/status/1696760933907882483) are operations to frame trans/non-binary people for sexual offences, all of whom are victims of Mercury. All three were [carried out by Faith Community Baptist Church](https://victimsofmalice.com/3rd-letter-3-bundles-release/#operations-ultraviolet).
1. Operation UltraViolet I: A desperate trans person was engaged to accuse Harvey of sexually penetrating them using her prosthetic penis in May 2023.
  * The accuser received extensive preparation in June and July of 2023.
  * The accuser was scheduled to lodge a police report in August 2023 with the help of a case worker.
  * The intention was for Harvey to be arrested on 10 September 2023 and arrained in court on 11 September 2023, to widespread media coverage.
  * The accuser has since decided to not participate in the operation.
2. Operation UltraViolet II: An accuser was found in June 2023 to accuse Joyce of causing the accuser to sexually penetrate her without the accuser's consent.
  * The accuser received extensive preparation in July and August of 2023.
  * The accuser was scheduled to file a police report in September 2023 so that Joyce could be apprehended in October 2023.
  * Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC) received assistance from Joyce's ex-partner Elise. In exchange, FCBC facilitated Elise's movement to an overseas jurisdiction.
  * The accuser has since decided to not participate in the operation.
3. Operation UltraViolet III: A 15-year-old accuser was found from Faith Community Baptist Church's Digital Wellness programme to accuse Odette of sexual exploitation.
  * Odette would be alleged to be the accuser's tutor and to have met the accuser in person.
  * The aim is to cast all categories of trans/non-binary persons as dangerous.

### Prelude: Operation Providence
**Operation Providence** was an [operation carried out by the Internal Security Department (ISD) in 2013](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#birth-of-2013-operation-providence-isd) to frame **Harvey** for a bomb hoax, in order to coerce Harvey into in turn framing Secretary-General of the Reform Party **Kenneth Jeyaretnam**. The goal was to stop Jeyaretnam from further investigation into the (mis)management of monies in the Central Provident Fund (CPF), Singapore's compulsory retirement savings scheme.
* During a visit to India in July/August 2000, Harvey was [betrothed](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#harvey-unexpected-betrothal-age-9), at the age of 9, to her maternal uncle's daughter.
* In late 2009, articles were published about **Balraj Naidu**, a founding member of the Reform Party who was extradited to the U.S. on [charges of providing arms and financial support to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#balraj-naidu-ltte-incident).
* In 2012, Jeyaretnam, in his capacity as Secretary-General of the Reform Party, investigated and publicly [asked questions](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#kenneth-jeyaretnam-inconvenient-questions) about discrepancies in the Government's accounts and impropriety in handling of funds.
* On 16 January 2013, Jeyaretnam filed his nomination for himself to run in the 2013 Punggol East SMC (Single Member Constituency) by-election.
  * Two days later, his family started receiving death threats.
* Harvey rejected the arranged marriage, once in [October 2012](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#harvey-rejects-arranged-marriage) and again in [March 2013](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#2013-poison-pen-incident-sivashakti).
  * The rejection humiliated the bride due to the cultural assumption of severe sexual impropriety or defectiveness.
* In July 2013, the bride's enraged mother, **Sivashakti**, wrote to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States of America that Harvey was plotting to bomb the United States embassy in Singapore. The CIA then transmitted this to the Singapore authorities.
* Singapore's Internal Security Department (ISD) began investigations into Harvey. They realised that Harvey had some distant connection with LTTE and is Facebook friends with one of Kenneth Jeyaretnam's sons, and conceptualized Operation Providence.
* On 22 July 2013, the police received a bomb hoax, which had actually been orchestrated by ISD. The police arrested and detained Harvey on 26 July 2013 for the bomb hoax.
* While in detention, ISD's Providence team approached Harvey and asked her to provide false testimony of having heard from Jeyaretnam's son that Kenneth Jeyaretnam was involved in Balraj Naidu's harboring and assistance to the LTTE. This was to implicate Jeyaretnam in terrorist activities.
* Harvey refused to cooperate in providing false testimony. ISD left Harvey to deal directly with law enforcement regarding the charge for the bomb hoax.
* Harvey was remanded for a week beginning on the 27th. She was subjected to [inhumane conditions](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#harvey-remanded-police-custody), with additional [beatings and sexual torture on ISD's instruction](https://victimsofmalice.com/operation-providence/#harvey-physical-sexual-torture-isd).

### Operation Anne Boleyn
As background, Singapore's **Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)** is responsible for the investigation and prevention of corruption in Singapore. The Director of CPIB reports to the Prime Minister of Singapore. If the Prime Minister does not give concurrence for CPIB to investigate a corruption complaint, the President may override the Prime Minister and give the required concurrence.

* The CPIB Director has been "educated on his place in the food chain", and Prime Minister **Lee Hsien Loong** will not give permission to the CPIB to investigate any of the victims' complaints.
  * Another of the complaints the Prime Minister intends to block, which does not come from the victims, is the [anonymous whistleblower complaint](https://textdoc.co/FGh6VD3R4ZkBrOXQ) about [**Operation Ink Tiger**](#operation-ink-tiger).
* If President **Tharman Shanmugaratnam** chooses to override the Prime Minister and give concurrence to the CPIB to investigate the complaints, the **Internal Security Department (ISD)** has [**Operation Anne Boleyn**](https://bafkreibim65tm5xreievmqg3mes3wfsjztxhsuxxrihvvxmmia2dwr5m2i.ipfs.w3s.link/) prepared as a contingency to kill President Tharman and replace him with Attorney-General [**Lucien Wong**](#lucien-wong).
  * Lucien Wong would then be replaced as Attorney-General by Lee Hsien Loong's current lawyer, **Davinder Singh**.
* Lucien Wong would run in a Presidential by-election against 2023 Presidential Election candidate Ng Kok Song, who would be encouraged by plants in his support base to run again.
* Second Minister for Finance **Indranee Rajah** (leader of [Operation Ink Tiger](#operation-ink-tiger) after Tan Chuan-Jin's resignation) is aware of Operation Anne Boleyn. She has advised ISD that it would be too politically costly to take political/procedural maneuvers to ensure that Lucien Wong runs uncontested.

### Operation Angel Dust
[Operation Angel Dust](https://victimsofmalice.com/operations-angel-dust-and-samael/#operation-angel-dust) is an operation by Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC). It involves spiking/drugging several targets with substances to incapacitate them or cause them to act up, with a different strategic objective for each target. The currently known targets are as follows:

* **Harvey** is the main target.
* **Zaia** is believed to be an important witness of some kind, who needs to be incapacitated or discredited.
* **Tobias Keh** is targeted for drugging as a precursor to the next operation: [Operation Samael](#operation-samael).

Harvey's drink had indeed been laced "in the early hours of 19 November [2023]" with "1ยฝ what was used on 28 April 2023", in order to cause her to commit offences under the influence. Gurther attempts are likely.

### Operation Samael
[Operation Samael](https://victimsofmalice.com/operations-angel-dust-and-samael/#operation-samael) is an operation by Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC) to frame Tobias Keh for impersonating Mercury.
* The operation involves lodging an online police report of a Soman threat under Mercury's name.
* The report and its filing would be made to look like the work of Tobias attempting to impersonate Mercury.
* Tobias would be discovered to have filed the report, and to have done so under the influence of substances from Operation Angel Dust.
* Where Mercury had impersonated many people and claims that those instances were in turn impersonation by others, Tobias would then become a viable suspect for being behind said instances.
* This would also introduce the substantive possibility that Mercury was also impersonated by others.
* To move towards a viable plan of execution for the Soman hoax, FCBC operatives have been iteratively workshopping execution scenarios with youths enrolled in their Digital Wellness programme, under the guise of "developing their critical thinking".
